## The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than actions. The four fundamental principles, or pillars, of OOP are:

### 1. Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

- **Benefits**:
  - Protects the integrity of the data by preventing outside code from directly modifying it.
  - Encapsulation helps in reducing complexity and increasing reusability.

**Example**:
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        self.__name = name  # Private attribute
        self.__age = age    # Private attribute
        self.__salary = salary  # Private attribute

    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    def set_salary(self, salary):
        if salary > 0:
            self.__salary = salary
```

### 2. Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a mechanism in which a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This allows for hierarchical classification and reuse of code.

- **Benefits**:
  - Promotes code reusability.
  - Establishes a natural hierarchy for relationships among classes.

**Example**:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def display(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.salary = salary

    def display(self):
        super().display()
        print(f"Salary: {self.salary}")
```

### 3. Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types. In practice, it allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies code and makes it more intuitive.
  - Enhances flexibility and integration by allowing different objects to be processed through the same interface.

**Example**:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

def make_animal_speak(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

make_animal_speak(dog)  # Outputs: Woof!
make_animal_speak(cat)  # Outputs: Meow!
```

### 4. Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It simplifies the complexity by allowing the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.

- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions.
  - Enhances code maintainability and flexibility.

**Example**:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)
print(f"Area: {rectangle.area()}")  # Outputs: Area: 50
print(f"Perimeter: {rectangle.perimeter()}")  # Outputs: Perimeter: 30
```
